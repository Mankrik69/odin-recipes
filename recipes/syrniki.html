    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Syrniki are traditional pancakes from Russia that are usually served for breakfast with jam or sour cream.
        They're made with a cheese called tvorog, but you can use farmer's cheese or quark, which are the closest
        substitutions in the U.S.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup quark, well drained</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla sugar (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat egg and white sugar together in a bowl until smooth. Whisk in quark cheese, flour, vanilla sugar, and
            salt. Mix well until dough is thick and sticky.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 5 to 6 portions. Form into balls and coat with some flour. Flatten slightly to form into
            discs (syrniki).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in skillet over medium-low heat. Add the syrniki; fry until browned, 5 minutes per side.</li>
    </ol>
